    About Me
  </h2>
  <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
    Currently based in Gwangju, South Korea, studying Computer Science on a full
    ride at GIST and working as a Junior Full Stack Dev at DEP. I’ve also
    freelanced, translated, and pushed pixels, but dev work is where I really
    lock in.
